orderItem can belong to Order and/or Cart. // At the time of purchase anyone's cart needs to be emptied.  

//orderItem and cartItem need to be different tables. 

Cart can belong to either User or Guest.  Same cart is always associated with guest session or 
 I still have the question about exclusive or 

 No I don't have this question anymore.  


cartItems: 



Are the current models ok?  OrderItem now has these foreign keys: cart_id, session

Steps on Authentication: should any of these be 
on authentication, 

1) do we care about knowing user's session id

2) classMethod on User: given user Id return cart_Id //put this route ?

3) make this a class method on orderItem? or does this belong in the same authentication route?

bulkUpdate:

It can take two parameters: guestSession.cart_id and user.cart_id

find every orderItem matching guestSession.cart_id
    for every orderItem

it overwrites the cart_id on orderItem with the User's cart_id

4) then destroy the guestsession ???


cart model --- user id sequelize association
                    --- session id column

unauthenticated --- put cart --> if first time initialize cart and since no req.user we add sessionId column

unauthenticated, made cart, logging in -- always have a cart already
    -- dispatch(login)
    -- dispatch(switchCart('/api/cart'))
            -- put cart
                    -- Need to add existingUserCartId to unauthCartItems
                        -- getUserCartId
                        -- getUnauthCartId
                        -- Need to delete unauthCart
                        -- CartItem.migrate(Cart.getUnauthCart(req.session.id), Cart.getUserCartId(req.user.id))
                                {
                                CartItem.update({})
                                .then(()=>{
                                    return unAuthCart.destroy()
                                })
                                }
                                -- CartItem has class method migrate
                                -- Cart has class methods getUnauthCart, getUserCartId
